## form-excel

### What is this?
It is a web application originally created for people to confirm attendance and menu to a certain event (in this case, was a wedding). This version lets you download an excel with the list of people.
The downside is that you have to download every time a number of people gets added to the database. Otherwise those people won`t be
in the excel list. It can be useful to someone.
